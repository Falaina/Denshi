Naoko's Commands

All commands and usernames are not case sensitive.
In the parameters, [] denotes an optional command, | denotes different possible commands, and () denotes grouping to reduce ambiguity.
None of these characters are used in the command parameters, except in the case of the translate command.

--- All Users ----
These commands are usable by all users, whether they're in IRC or Synchtube.

    Responds with one of the standard magic eight ball responses to the given question.

ask question
    Responds yes or no to the given question.

    Displays whether Naoko is muted or not. This is displayed even if she is muted.

translate [[bb] | [aa>bb] | [aa->bb]] string
    Translates the given string from aa, which defaults to detecting the language, to bb, which defaults to en, using Microsoft Translate.
    The languages aa and bb must be specified as an ISO two letter language code.
    Note: If source or destination language are provided, they will be provided in the form "[bb]" or "[aa->bb]", including the square brackets. The internal square brackets are part of the parameters.

wolfram query
    Sends the given query to the Wolfram API and returns the primary or first result.

--- Synchtube Users Only ---
These commands are usable by both mods and non-mods in the Synchtube chat, but not in IRC.

addrandom X
    Adds X random videos to the list, where X defaults to five. The maximum value of X for non-mods is five. Non-mods can only use this command when there are ten or less videos in the playlist.
    This command is throttled so that it can only be called by any user once every five seconds.
    Less restrictions affect mods.

delete
    Deletes the last video added by the user who calls this command. This will not delete the currently playing video.
    Due to how Synchtube handles adding videos for unregistered but named users, no unregistered users can delete their own videos, and this command is disabled for them.
    More options are available to mods.

lastban
lastbans
    Displays the last ban for the name of the user who calls this command, including the time of the ban, the reason, and the name of the mod who initiated the ban.
    More options are available to mods. Lastbans will only provide a single ban for non-mods, and will also default to one for mods.

permissions
    Display the hybrid mod permissions for the user who calls this command.
    More options are available to mods.

--- Synchtube Mods Only ---
These commands are only available to Synchtube mods in Synchtube chat. Some commands are available to hybrid mods with specific permissions.
There are no differences between mods and hybrid mods, save only that hybrid mods are not protected from some commands such as ban like real mods are, and they cannot use the
special parameters for the kick command.

addrandom X
    Hybrid mod permission +A.
    Adds X random videos to the list, where X defaults to five. The maximum value of X for mods is 20. Mods can call this regardless of the length of the playlist.
    The five second limit for successive calls still applies to mods.

autolead on | off
    Hybrid more permission +U.
    Sets whether Naoko will automatically take leader when she reconnects. She will (currently) not automatically take leader when there is no playlist.

autosetskip on | off | none | number | percentage
    Hybrid mod permission +V.
    Changes the default skip settings that will be set whenever Naoko reconnects. This will override any current settings in the room even if she is only restarted
    with the restart command.
    See setskip for an explanation of the possible parameters. If none is sent autosetskip will be disabled.

ban name [reason]
    Hybrid Mod permission +Q.
    Bans the specified user. The reason, which defaults to "Requested," is not displayed to the user who is being banned, though it is stored in the database.
    Cannot ban mods.

    Hybrid mod permission +Q.
    Displays the list of currently banned users. If the -v flag is provided it also displays the IDs of the banned users.

bump [name | -unnamed]
    Hybrid mod permission +B.
    Bumps the last video added by the specified user to the next spot on the playlist after the current video. If -unnamed is provided it will bump the last video without a name.
    This includes videos added by any unregistered user, named or unnamed.

clean
    Hybrid mod permission +C.
    Cleans the playlist by removing all the videos that are above the current video in the playlist.
    Naoko does not check or have any way of telling if those videos have actually been played or not.

delete [name | -unnamed]
    Hybrid mod permission +D.
    In addition to the functionality outlined above, deletes the last video added by the user with the given name, or the last video added by any unregistered user.

duplicates
    Hybrid mod permission +T.
    Deletes duplicate videos from the playlist. Will not remove the currently playing video even if it is a duplicate.
    Leaves the first occurence of any duplicated video on the list, even if it is above the currently playing video.

endpoll
    Hybrid mod permissions +G.
    Ends the current poll.

hybridmods [on | off]
    Enables or disables hybrid mods if on or off are passed.
    With neither Naoko will list all the current hybridmods with active permissions.
    This is written to the hybridmods file so the status will be maintained.

kick (name [reason]) | -unnamed | -unregistered
    Hybrid mod permission +K.
    Kicks the specified user. The reason, which defaults to "Requested," is displayed to the user who is being kicked.
    If -unnamed or -unregistered is passed instead, it will kick all unnamed users or all unregistered users at once. Only real mods can use these values.
    Cannot kick mods.

lastban [name | -all]
lastbans [(name | -all) [X]]
    Displays the last X bans, where X defaults to 1, of any users with the given name. If -all is provided instead of a name the last X bans for any users will b displayed.

mod name
    Hybrid mod permission +O.
    Changes the leader to the user with the given name.

mute
unmute
    Hybrid mod permission +M.

permissions [(+ | -) (all | flags)] name

    If no changes are specified, or if changes do take place, Naoko will display the current permissions of the hybrid mod.
